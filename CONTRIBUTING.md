### Workflow and Pull Requests

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests and reviewing changes.

_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done‚Ä¶

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. A guide on how to fork a
   repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

   Open your terminal (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash or Git Shell) and type:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/phenomic
   cd phenomic
   git checkout -b my_branch
   ```

   Note: Replace `<your_username>` with your GitHub username

2. Phenomic uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for running development scripts.
   If you haven't already done so, please
   [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

   To check your version of Yarn and ensure it's installed you can type:

   ```sh
   yarn --version
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **We currently require yarn >= v1.0.0**

3. Run `yarn`. This will install all dependencies and prepare the repository to
   be ready for serious shit.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

5. If you've added/changed APIs, update the documentation accordingly.

6. Ensure the entire test suite passes via `yarn test`.

#### Additional Workflow for any changes made to website or docs

If you are making changes to the website or documentation, test the `docs`
folder and run the server to check if your changes are being displayed
accurately.

You can run a development server to check if the changes you made are being
displayed accurately by running `yarn run docs:start`.

You can modify `docs/*` code and get real times update in your browser.

**Keep in mind that whenever you modify Phenomic core/plugins you might need to
restart the dev server.** If you are doing change to Phenomic using the docs as
a playground, you may need to transpile sources. See below for more
informations.

## How to try a development build of Phenomic in another project

### Transpiling sources

Phenomic is written with ES2015+ and is using [babel](http://babeljs.io) for
transpilation. In order to have up to date code for real world usage, you need
to start a watcher from the root of the project

```console
yarn run watch
```

This will update transpilated files as soon as you modify one.

### Use a local Phenomic version your own project

From Phenomic git repo

```console
yarn run links
```

This should create local links for each packages.

Then, in your project:

```console
yarn link @phenomic/core @phenomic/preset-react-app ...
```

**You should probably add all others direct `@phenomic/*` deps from your
`package.json` if necessary.**

Then run your project via `yarn start`, and don't forget to restart dev server
if necessary (if you change the code of Phenomic itself).

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues) for
our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when
we have a work in progress. **Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your
problem doesn't already exist.**

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please
provide a public repository with a runnable example. Then feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/new).

#### Security Bugs

If you find a security issue, please first contact us directly before opening a
public issue.

## Releasing

Update necessary `bsconfig.json` (eg: `packages/reason/bsconfig.json`) version
number and stage the file in git (so release script gets it).

```
yarn release
```

The command will guide you.

Once it's done, go to https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/releases. Click on
the new created tag and `Edit tag` to create release notes.

The way to create notes is easy. Just go to
https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commits/master and sort interesting commits
(since last release) in the template below that you will use as notes:

```
# üéâ No breaking changes üéâ
