# Create static websites like apps

## Phenomic is a modular website compiler that helps you build static websites optimised for SEO and UX

[Get Started]()

## A static site generator like no other

Phenomic is a modular website compiler that helps you to build static websites,
with a modern approach: you will **make your website the same way you build an
app**.

1. Get your content (Markdown, JSON... From fs, REST, GraphQL APIs...)
2. Write your templates (Choose your renderer (React, Vue, Handlebars...))
3. Compile your website (Deploy it on any static hosting service)

## A website built with things you like

Phenomic is different from other SSG by allowing you to pick the technologies,
libraries, frameworks of your choice and build your website with it. You can
decide to rely on [React]() or [Vue](), [Webpack]() or [Rollup]() etc. If the
solution you are looking for is not implemented yet, Phenomic accepts plugins so
you can bring your own flavor!

[Choose your flavor]()

## A static website, 100% SEO friendly

When development is done, Phenomic will help you to produce for you **static
files** that you can deploy on any static hosting (HTML, CSS and JavaScript
files). The result will be **an SEO friendly website** (all pages built and can
be served as HTML files) and **optimised for fast browsing** (after the first
HTML page, JavaScript files will handle client side navigation and only download
what is necessary without full pages reload).

## A website with lightning fast UX

This way you offer the **best user experience** by immediately serving
pre-generated HTML for first visits (or all pages, for search engine bots and
browsers that don't interpret JavaScript) and then using the power of JavaScript
you **avoid full page reload** by only downloading small chunks of data for each
pages & interactions.
