## Hot loading

You might be interested by hot loading, which allow you to edit your code and
get instant feedback in your browser.
By default, CSS changes will already be instantly hot loaded, like the content.
But you might also want to tweak your React components in real time.
In order to do that, you have to edit a little your `App.js`:

Replace this

```js
import { createApp } from '@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/client';

// ...

export default createApp(
  () =>
    <Router history={browserHistory}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Router>,
  Html
);
```

By the following code:

```js
import { createApp, renderApp } from '@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/client';

// ...

const routes = () =>
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    {/* ... */}
  </Router>;

export default createApp(routes, Html);

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept(() => renderApp(routes));
}
```

``@phenomic/plugin-bundler-webpack`` and ``@phenomic/plugin-renderer-react`` have
``react-hot-loader@3.x`` requirements so everything should works like a charm.
