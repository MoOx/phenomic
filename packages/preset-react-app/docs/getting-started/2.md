# Your first page

Now we will need to create the entry point of you website/app.
Let's create a file ``App.js``

```js
import React from "react"
import { Router, Route, browserHistory } from "react-router"
import { createApp } from "@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/client"

const Home = () => (
  <div>
    <p>This is a homepage</p>
  </div>
)

export default createApp(() => (
  <Router history={ browserHistory }>
    <Route path="/" component={ Home } />
  </Router>
))
```

Here we defined a router with one route that will be the homepage.
Let's check this page in a browser.

## Starting the development server

Phenomic CLI have 2 commands: ``start`` (development server) and ``build`` (to generate static build).

Let's add this commands into some scripts of the ``package.json``

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "phenomic start",
    "build": "phenomic build"
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>See complete <code>package.json</code></summary>

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
    "@phenomic/core": "^1.0.0",
    "@phenomic/cli": "^1.0.0",
    "@phenomic/preset-react-app": "^1.0.0",
    "react": "^15.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^15.0.0",
    "react-router": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "phenomic": {
    "presets": [
      "@phenomic/preset-react-app"
    ]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "phenomic start",
    "build": "phenomic build"
  }
}
```

</details>

Now we can use ``npm start`` to start the website/app.
Website/app should be accessible via [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

Enjoy you hello world!
