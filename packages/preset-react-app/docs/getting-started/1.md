# Installation of  of Phenomic with ``@phenomic/preset-react-app``

The react preset we are going to use will work with React and Webpack.

```console
npm install --save-dev react react-dom react-router
npm install --save-dev @phenomic/core @phenomic/cli @phenomic/preset-react-app
```

This lines will install Phenomic and its [react app preset](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/packages/preset-react-app).

The react preset will allow you to consume Markdown and JSON files as data resources
to generate your website/app.
