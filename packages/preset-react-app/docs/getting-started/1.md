# Installation of Phenomic with ``@phenomic/preset-react-app``

The react preset we are going to use will work with React and Webpack.

```console
npm install --save-dev react react-dom react-router@^3.0.0
npm install --save-dev @phenomic/core @phenomic/cli @phenomic/preset-react-app
```

These lines will install Phenomic and its [react app preset](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/packages/preset-react-app).

The react preset will allow you to consume Markdown and JSON files as data resources
to generate your website/app.

## Configuration

Here we going to tell Phenomic the plugins we want to use via the preset.
To do so, we are going to add a ``phenomic`` section in our ``package.json``

```json
{
  ...
  "phenomic": {
    "presets": [
      "@phenomic/preset-react-app"
    ]
  }
}
```
