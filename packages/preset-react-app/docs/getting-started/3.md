# Adding a page from markdown file

One homepage is cool, but we might want to add more content.
Let's create a markdown file in our ``content`` folder.

We are going to put the file in ``content/posts/first-post.md``.

```md
# This is a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example) file

If you are new to Markdown, you might want to check those links:

- [What is Markdown?](http://whatismarkdown.com/)
- [Mastering Markdown, a GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example)
- [masteringmarkdown.com](http://masteringmarkdown.com/)
```

Note that the folder name is important for you: the first sub-folder is the key
for our collection.
In our example, the collection generated is ``posts``.

Now let's add a simple route to our ``App.js``

```js
export default createApp(() =>
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={Home} />
    <Route path="/blog/*" component={BlogPostContainer} />
  </Router>
);
```

We also need to create a ``BlogPostContainer`` component to render the posts.

```js
import {
  createApp,
  createContainer,
  query,
  BodyRenderer
} from '@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/client';

// ...

const BlogPost = ({ isLoading, page }) =>
  <div>
    {isLoading && 'Loading...'}
    {!isLoading &&
      page.node &&
      <article>
        <h1>{page.node.title}</h1>
        <BodyRenderer>{page.node.body}</BodyRenderer>
      </article>}
    <footer>
      <Link to="/">Go to home</Link>
    </footer>
  </div>;

const BlogPostContainer = createContainer(BlogPost, props => ({
  page: query({ collection: 'posts', id: props.params.splat })
}));
```

Here we are introducing a key concept of Phenomic: the collection and how to use
those.

In your ``content`` folder, all sub-folders will be _keys_ for your content that
will allow you to sort and retrieve resources
_(Note that this is subject to change for before final v1 as we are not
  completely sold on this)._

In our example above, we are doing a ``query`` on the collection ``posts``.
We are using the ``id`` to find a single item.
``id`` is the filename after the sub-folder, in our case ``first-post``
(the .md extension is ignored, and ``stuff/index.md`` being considered as ``stuff``).

## Accessing the markdown page

We just created a route and a component to retrieve the markdown file.
Now we can access our post by accessing directly [http://localhost:3333/blog/first-post/](http://localhost:3333/blog/first-post/).
