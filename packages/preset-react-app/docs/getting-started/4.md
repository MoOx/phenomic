# Generating list of pages

Accessing directly an url is cool, but only when you know it!
It would be nice to have a list of existing pages (in our case, ``posts``).
So let's add an index on our ``Home``!

For this we will need to wrap our ``Home`` with a container like for ``BlogPosts``.
The difference here is that we are going to make a query an entire path.

```js
const HomeContainer = createContainer(Home, () => ({
  posts: query({ path: 'posts' })
}));
```

It's easier than before, same ``query``, but without ``id``.

Now we need to change our route to use ``HomeContainer`` instead of ``Home``

```js
export default createApp(() =>
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={HomeContainer} />
    <Route path="/blog/*" component={BlogPostContainer} />
  </Router>
);
```

Maybe you noticed that we actually didn't use our resources in our ``Home`` component?
Let's display the list of posts with this change

```js
import { Router, Route, browserHistory, Link } from 'react-router';
// ..

const Home = ({ isLoading, posts }) =>
  <div>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    {isLoading && 'Loading...'}
    {!isLoading &&
      <ul>
        {posts &&
          posts.node &&
          posts.node.list &&
          posts.node.list.map(post =>
            <li key={post.id}>
              <Link to={`/blog/${post.id}/`}>
                {post.title || post.id}
              </Link>
            </li>
          )}
      </ul>}
  </div>;
```

Now your homepage should render a list with your single post.
But wait, the label being used is the ``id``?!
This can be improved by adding meta data into your markdown file.

## The front-matter

At the top of each markdown file, we can a "front-matter" in a section separated by  the 3 dashes ``---``.
You can store anything you want in there.
It's by default a
[YAML section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Sample_document),
but you can use
[other formats like JSON, TOML, JavaScript...](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter#highlights).

Let's modify our file with a ``title`` property.
And while we are editing this file, we can also add a ``date``

```md
---
title: "First post"
date: "2017-01-01"
---

# This is a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example) file

...
```

Now, check out your homepage, you should see the title.
Keep in mind that this front-matter can contains all kind of informations like
date, authors name, tags, image reference etc.
By default some keys are automatically interpreted as way to query your content.
This allows you to query posts for a single author, a specific tag and even order by date.
