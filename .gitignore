# Yarn
# I (@MoOx) know that yarn.lock exist to be versionned
# but in the case of a product like us, we don't control user package.json so
# it's only hiding us some potential semver issue.
# It pretty cool for local full testing, but at some point, we need to do some
# cleanup (e.g. before cutting a release) to ensure this will work in real world
# Maybe we should pin our deps (even if deps of deps are not under our control)
# but that's kind of another story
# Feel free to open a discussion about that ;)
