- Changed: ``layouts`` should not be defined in build and client scripts
  anymore. This method will be deprecated in a future version.
  Instead please directly pass ``layouts`` in the ``routes`` definitions with a
  HoC.
  Here is an example:

  ```js
  import React, { Component } from "react"
  import { Route } from "react-router"

  import LayoutContainer from "../LayoutContainer"
  import StatinamicPageContainer from "statinamic/lib/PageContainer"

  import Page from "../layouts/Page"
  import PageError from "../layouts/PageError"
  import PageLoading from "../layouts/PageLoading"
  import Homepage from "../layouts/Homepage"

  class PageContainer extends Component {
    render() {
      const { props } = this
      return (
        <StatinamicPageContainer
          { ...props }
          layouts={ {
            Page,
            PageError,
            PageLoading,
            Homepage,
          } }
        />
      )
    }
  }

  export default (
    <Route component={ LayoutContainer }>
      <Route path="*" component={ PageContainer } />
    </Route>
  )
  ```

  You should take a new look to the [default boilerplate](boilerplate).

- Added: Use node-portfinder to avoid error when port is used
  ([#320](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/320))

## Boilerplate

- Fixed: ``PageError`` warning about missing PropTypes
  ([#357](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/357)).

- Changed: Bump css-loader to ^0.23.0. This may improve performance a little bit
  ([#374](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/374))

- Changed: ``PageError`` is nicer and now looks like documentation 404.

- Changed: Production build now produces short CSS classnames. You should apply this
  change for a smaller HTML file.
  ([#385](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/385))

- Added: a ``PageLoading`` component is now provided and include 2 indicators:
  - A [topbar](https://github.com/buunguyen/topbar) via
    [react-topbar-progress-indicator](https://github.com/MoOx/react-topbar-progress-indicator).
  - A simple CSS loading spinner.

  ([#182](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/182)).

- Added: link to 404 and loading page in the footer, so new users can see and
  try those easily.

# 0.9.3 - 2016-04-04

## Boilerplate

- Removed: Remove unused define environment variables in webpack client config
  ([#315](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/351))

# 0.9.2 - 2016-03-22

- Fixed: Missing babel-register package.
  ([#335](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/335))

# 0.9.1 - 2016-03-21

- Fixed: default boilerplate have a correct .gitignore file (not .npmignore)
  ([#323](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/323))

# 0.9.0 - 2016-03-21

→ [Example of update from 0.8 to 0.9](https://github.com/putaindecode/putaindecode.io/commit/4eea549?w=1)

## tl;dr;

### Breaking changes

- ``md-collection-loader`` has been renamed to ``content-loader``.
- Default markdown parser is now remark _but you can use anything you want, even
  a non markdown parser (eg: latex, asciidocs...)._
  **``markdownIt`` configuration is not supported any more but you can still use
  the same engine, see details below.**
- ``scripts/webpack.config.*.js`` now needs to export function that accept
  config as the first parameter.
- ``scripts/config.js`` is now responsible for exporting webpack configurations.
- (minor) ``redux-devtools`` and ``redux-thunk`` have been removed
  (``redux`` will become private soon anyway, or might even be dropped).

### Minor changes

- Less boilerplate for commands to start/build.

### Patches

- No more duplicates in collection.
- No more `main.*.css` files in `dist`.
- Anchors in url are not being removed when clicking a link with an anchor.
- Network errors are not reported as 404 anymore, but as network errors.

## Details

- Changed: simplified boilerplate and "start" and "build" commands !
  **Be sure to checkout new (smaller) boilerplate**.
  - ``scripts/webpack.config.*.js`` now needs to export function that accept
    config as the first parameter.
  - ``scripts/config.js`` is now responsible for exporting webpack configurations.
  - You can replace ``start`` and ``build`` npm scripts by
    ``statinamic start/build``
  - ``scripts/build.js`` do not need to expose webpack configuration anymore
    (since it's included in ``config`` object).
  - You can now remove awkward babel env configuration from your babel
    configuration. _It's now handled secretly by default_.
    (that's why ``config`` must expose your webpack configurations)
  - You webpack configuration can now skip some tiny weird part specific to
    statinamic.
- Changed: Use localhost as default address to open new browser tab (for Windows
  compatibility since Windows doesn't resolve 0.0.0.0 as localhost/127.0.0.1)
  ([#257](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/257))
- Changed: **``md-collection-loader`` has been renamed to ``content-loader``.**
- Changed: ``content-loader`` now use [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark)
  as the default markdown engine.
  - If you want to use the new engine, just remove your ``markdownIt`` section
    in your ``scripts/webpack.config.babel.js`` configuration.
    You will also probably need to update in your CSS references to
    ``.markdownIt-Anchor`` to ``.statinamic-HeadingAnchor``.
  - If you want to keep your current engine, just take the content of your
    ``markdownIt`` section, wrap it in a function and return ``.render()``
    method.

    - Remove this of your ``scripts/webpack.config.babel.js``

      ```js
      // ...
      markdownIt: (
        require("markdown-it")({
          html: true,
          // ...
        })
          .use(/* ... */)
      )
      ```

    - Add in the configuration of ``content-loader``
      (former ``md-collection-loader``)

      ```js
      // ...
      { // statinamic requirement
        test: /\.md$/,
        loader: "statinamic/lib/content-loader",
        query: {
          context: path.join(config.cwd, config.source),
          // WRAP HERE
          renderer: (text) => (
            require("markdown-it")({
              html: true,
              // ...
            })
              .use(/* ... */)
              .render(text) // ADD THIS
          )
          // ...
        }
      )
      ```

- Changed: Remove redux devtools and `process.env.CLIENT` environment variables.
  Redux will probably become part of the private API, which will reduce
  the boilerplate. In order to do that, we will gradually remove Redux from all
  public interface ([#40](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/40)).
  Here is the instruction to pull this change:

  - Remove `redux-devtools`, `redux-devtools-log-monitor` and
  `redux-devtools-dock-monitor` from your dependencies list.
  - Remove these variables in webpack.config.client.js, DefinePlugin section:

    - ``process.env.REDUX_DEVTOOLS``
    - ``process.env.CLIENT`` : This is totally up you.
      You can keep it if you use it.
      We recommended you to use a more portable way to do this:

    ```diff
    ---if (process.env.CLIENT) {
    +++if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      // client-side specific code
    }
    ```

  See ([#261](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/261)) for details.
- Removed: unused ``redux-thunk`` middleware.
  ([#279](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/279))
- Added: ``content-loader`` now accept any renderer.
  You can provide your own callback to transform the text content into html
  via the `renderer` option.
  See _Configuration_ section of the documentation.
- Added: Support React to 15.x
- Fixed: ``statinamic/lib/enhance-collection`` do not create duplicates anymore
  ([#200](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/200))
- Fixed: network errors will not appear as 404 error anymore
- Fixed: `main.*.css` files are not produced anymore by the default boilerplate
  ([#214](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/214))
- Fixed: url with anchors are NOT being replaced with url without anchors
  anymore
  ([#284](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/284))
- Added: ``statinamic/lib/enhance-collection`` will warn if filter callback
  don’t return a boolean

# 0.7.0 - 2016-02-12

Lot's of changes in the boilerplate (`scripts/*`).
You should better watch the default boilerplate and grab most of it, then add
back your original modifications.
This changes have been introduced for the better. Pages are now pre-rendered
during development and static build should be faster than before.

- Removed: ``collection.json`` file does not exist anymore. The collection is
  now inlined in generated html pages, even during development so we can use and
  access the collection directly and it avoid a server/client request.
- Removed: All injected constantes like ``__DEV__`` and ``__PROD__`` have been
  replaced by ``process.env.*`` call to make code more universal
  (eg: ``if (__DEV__)`` => ``if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production")``).
- Changed: remove mkdirp in favor of [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fs-extra)
  ([#126](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/126))

  ``statinamic-static.js`` script.
  Every webpack transformations are now handled via
  [babel-plugin-webpack-loaders](babel-plugin-webpack-loaders).
  to avoid the old painful/slow process.
  See boilerplate changes (look for ``BABEL_ENV=statinamic`` and babel
  configuration in ``package.json`` and in webpack client config).
- Changed: collection is now passed in the React
  [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html)],
  not in the store anymore.
- Changed: ``pageComponents`` are now called ``layouts``.
  All references should be renamed accordingly. See boilerplate changes.
- Changed: ``defaultComponent`` prop of ``PageContainer`` is now
  ``defaultLayout``
- Changed: layouts are now passed in the React context, not in the store
  anymore. So you need to pass them in the client script now (see boilerplate
  change).
- Changed: ``react-router`` has been upgraded to v2.0.0
  ([#95](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/95))

- Added: the entire configuration is now inspected so you do not provide
  unexpected types or unrecognized configuration values
  ([#120](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/120))

  options like ``CNAME``.
- Added: ``CNAME`` option to generate a ``CNAME`` file according to your
  homepage

- Added: ``nojekyll`` option to create `.nojekyll` file.
- Added: ``verbose`` option to create get more informations during development.
- Added: ``devHost`` and ``devPort`` options so you can choose your url during
  development.
- Added: Development server now generate pre-rendered pages on the fly.
- Added: Allow to pass extra middlewares and store enhancers to redux store
  ([#102](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/102))
