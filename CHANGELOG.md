# 0.7.0 - 2016-02-12

Lot's of changes in the boilerplate (`scripts/*`).
You should better watch the default boilerplate and grab most of it, then add
back your original modifications.
This changes have been introduced for the better. Pages are now pre-rendered
during development and static build should be faster than before.

- Removed: ``collection.json`` file does not exist anymore. The collection is
  now inlined in generated html pages, even during development so we can use and
  access the collection directly and it avoid a server/client request.
- Removed: All injected constantes like ``__DEV__`` and ``__PROD__`` have been
  replaced by ``process.env.*`` call to make code more universal
  (eg: ``if (__DEV__)`` => ``if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production")``).
- Changed: remove mkdirp in favor of [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fs-extra)
  ([#126](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/126))
- Changed: logs are now handled by [debug](https://www.npmjs.org/package/debug)
  ([#124](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/124))
- Changed: Move opinionated deps to optionalPeerDependencies
  ([#99](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/99))
- Changed: the static build does not require a 3 steps process anymore. No more
  ``statinamic-static.js`` script.
  Every webpack transformations are now handled via
  [babel-plugin-webpack-loaders](babel-plugin-webpack-loaders).
  to avoid the old painful/slow process.
  See boilerplate changes (look for ``BABEL_ENV=statinamic`` and babel
  configuration in ``package.json`` and in webpack client config).
- Changed: collection is now passed in the React
  [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html)],
  not in the store anymore.
- Changed: ``pageComponents`` are now called ``layouts``.
  All references should be renamed accordingly. See boilerplate changes.
- Changed: ``defaultComponent`` prop of ``PageContainer`` is now
  ``defaultLayout``
- Changed: layouts are now passed in the React context, not in the store
  anymore. So you need to pass them in the client script now (see boilerplate
  change).
- Changed: ``react-router`` has been upgraded to v2.0.0
  ([#95](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/95))
- Changed: ``redux`` as been upgraded to v4.x
  ([#91](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/91))
- Fixed: Dev server now redirects pages without trailing slash
  (eg: You call ``http://.../some/thing``; will redirect to
  ``http://.../some/thing/``)
  ([#22](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/22))
- Added: the entire configuration is now inspected so you do not provide
  unexpected types or unrecognized configuration values
  ([#120](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/120))
- Added: ``assets`` option to add static assets such as images, video
  ([#94](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/94))
- Added: ``statinamic`` section in ``package.json`` can be used to define core
  options like ``CNAME``.
- Added: ``CNAME`` option to generate a ``CNAME`` file according to your
  homepage
  ([#24](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/issues/24))
- Added: ``nojekyll`` option to create `.nojekyll` file.
- Added: ``verbose`` option to create get more informations during development.
- Added: ``devHost`` and ``devPort`` options so you can choose your url during
  development.
- Added: Development server now generate pre-rendered pages on the fly.
- Added: Allow to pass extra middlewares and store enhancers to redux store
  ([#102](https://github.com/MoOx/statinamic/pull/102))
