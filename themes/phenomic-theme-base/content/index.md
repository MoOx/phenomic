Hi there.

Before having fun with Phenomic, be sure to read (or at least pretend to)
the documentationÂ :

* [Setup](https://phenomic.io/docs/setup/)
* [Getting Started](https://phenomic.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Usage](https://phenomic.io/docs/usage/)
* [FAQ](https://phenomic.io/docs/faq/)

Also take a look to
[existing websites that use Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/showcase/),
some projects share their source code!

Built with

You may want to take a look to the <a href="/404.html">404.html</a>.

If you want to adjust those, directly adjust them in ``src/layouts/``.
