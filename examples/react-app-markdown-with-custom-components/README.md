# React app: markdown with custom components

This example show you own to render normal and custom html tags as your own
React components.

_In short, you can replace `<sometag>` by a react component `SomeTag` and get
children nodes (text or other nodes) as objects (not just raw html) to render
those as you like._

ðŸš€ **So wow, such power!**
